<p>One incredible advantage of using R-Markdown is its ability as a platform to be compatible with tons of languages apart from R such as: Python, SQL, Javascript, CSS, and more. R is a powerful tool, but sometimes the need arises to use a different language like Python, that is faster and contains packages that might not be available in R.
Here, we explore how to use Python on R-Markdown and an introduction to Python basics.</p>
<p>Functions are very useful because they save us time that would have otherwise been spent rewriting chunks of code over and over again.</p>
<pre class="python"><code># this function takes in a string as its input and reverses it!
def reverse_string (word):
    result = &quot;&quot;
    for i in word :
         result = i + result
    return result      

# call the function
print(&quot;your string reversed looks like: &quot;,reverse_string(&quot;the house was made of jellybeans&quot;))</code></pre>
<pre><code>## your string reversed looks like:  snaebyllej fo edam saw esuoh eht</code></pre>
<p>Regular expression (RegEx) is also handy when looking for specific patterns in large files as opposed to doing it manually. For example, given the very large string of letters and numbers below, if we wanted to extract only the urls, we could use re.findall() to specify what we are looking for it and return a list of all the matching subset strings</p>
<pre class="python"><code># import the RegEx package 
import re

string = &quot;&lt;http://www.classmates.com/go/e/200988231/CC123101BT/CM00&gt;  &lt;http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/spacer.gif&gt;  &lt;http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/sp \

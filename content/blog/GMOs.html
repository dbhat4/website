<p>Given the fact that the world population is currently growing at 1.05% per year (Worldometer, 2020) and the Earth is swiftly reaching its carrying capacity - which is 9 billion - it is no surprise that food security is becoming an increasingly relevant topic. If we plan to farm in a conventional manner to meet this rising food demand, we will need to destroy acres and acres of primary habitat (Bakshi, 2003), and if not, we run the risk of millions more people facing starvation and malnutrition across the world. According to a 2005 study, even if we are just focusing on the 23 most nutritionally important crops, projected crop land will need to be increased by 23% in developing countries to support the population in 2050 (Scharlemann, 2005). This increased land encroachment will have disastrous ecological impacts; a study on distribution and causation of species endangerment in the United States revealed that “agriculture affects more endangered species than urban development” (Brian Czech, 199). The Green Revolution of the late 20th century no doubt helped to curb world starvation and keep global collapse at bay for a few decades. However, Borlaug himself was aware of the fact that it was but a temporary solution; population growth will always present new challenges and we now find ourselves needing a new solution.</p>


<p>        What if we had a way of growing food in an easy to scale-up, faster, and cheaper way? This is precisely what genetically modified organisms (GMOs) seem to offer us. Preliminary statistics alone have shown that genetically modified crops have “Increased global production by 357.7 million tons of corn, 180.3 million tons of soybean, 25.2 million tons of cotton fiber, 10.6 million tons of canola and about a ton of sugar beet” (Norero, 2018). This dramatic increase in yield has greatly reduced the amount of land needed for agriculture. Although from this data, GMOs might seem like a catch-all solution that requires no further thinking, the main problem lies in the public’s wariness and distrust of them as a food source. Although there is no one ‘solution’ to change the perception of society, in this paper, I will discuss how many arguments put forth by the anti-GMO community are without foundation or are sourced from inaccurate data.</p>

<br>
<p>        Let’s start with what a GMO is. A GMO is “an organism whose genome has been engineered in the laboratory in order to favor the expression of desired physiological traits or the generation of desired biological products”. Some of the most consumed foods such as corn, cotton, soy, and alfalfa, are GMOs (Diaz, 2020). The vast majority of these crops are genetically engineered for two main reasons; either to express genes from the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) bacteria that make the crops resistant to pests, and/or to express a glyphosate-tolerant EPSPS gene that makes crops tolerant to the “Round-Up” herbicide, which can then be sprayed non-selectively on crops with the assurance that it will just kill weeds and not the crops themselves.</p>
<p>        It is interesting how quickly the negative connotation for genetically modified organisms came about considering how deeply embedded GMOs are in our lives whether we are aware of them or not. From the life-saving insulin, which was first manufactured in 1982 by inserting the human insulin gene into a bacterial plasmid (NIH, n.d.), to canola oil - often dubbed as the healthiest oil from a dietary standpoint (Bruno, 2019) - which is made from canola crops engineered to be glyphosate resistant, GMOs are virtually unavoidable. Fig.2 below shows the extent of the omnipresence of GM crops in our world in 2015.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>        Although there are hundreds of arguments against GMOs, public rejection of GMOs as a food source can be subdivided into two main categories: the alleged linkage between glyphosate and cancer in humans and the rise of organic foods as the supposed protagonist in the fight to conquer GMOs.</p>

<p>        The first fear - the notion that glyphosate is linked to cancer in humans - is actually part of a larger problem, which is misinformation and confirmation bias among the non-scientific community. The best example of this is the notorious Seralini study that claimed to have proof that GMO maize caused multiple tumors in rats when fed to them. An already feared topic mediated a quick dispersal of these fallacious results to the masses. What most people didn’t know, however, was that the rats Seralini used in this study were about 18 months old (rats live only about 2 years on average) and, therefore, had a higher than average predisposal to tumors in general (Casassus, 2014). This paper has been discredited by multiple GMO experts and eventually even retracted in 2013 due to its insufficiencies, but its impact was lasting and by the time it got retracted, the damage had already been done. This example of flawed study design is just one example in a list of many. Another technique that seems to be quite popular among people who want to see GMOs gone for good is the utilization of loopholes in studies to make data seem to have a causative relationship with results. An example of this is the claim that Jeffrey Smith made in his 2007 book ‘Genetic Roulette’, saying that GM tomatoes caused gastric lesions and even fatalities among rats that they were fed to. Upon further investigation, it was found that not only were these numbers inflated but also the amount of tomatoes the rats were being fed on a daily basis was in itself fatal (regardless of organic or GMO) because it caused a fatal overload of potassium in their bodies (GM Tomatoes Proven Safe, n.d.).</p>

<p>        While still on the topic of Glyphosate, it is understandable that the public is afraid of the side-consequences of consuming chemicals used on their plants, however, it is also important to remember that these chemicals were a lot worse a few decades ago. Glyphosate has a long list of nasty predecessors such as Alachlor, Metolachlor, and Cyanizine. These chemicals have LD50s of 930, 1200, ad 182 mg/kg respectively in rats (Hulk, 2015). ‘LD50’ stands for ‘lethal dosage’ and is a measure of the amount of a compound (per kg of the organism being tested on) that would be required to kill 50% of the test population (CCOHS, 2018). Interpreting this in context, this means that only 930 mg/kg of Alachlor would be sufficiently lethal to kill 50% of the test population. The LD50 of glyphosate on the other hand, is 5,600 mg/kg (CCOHS, 2018), which is at least 4 times higher than all of the above chemical (meaning that four times as much glyphosate would be needed before the dosage could be considered lethal). From these facts, it would seem that the quantity of herbicide/pesticide being used is not as significant as its overall impact on humans and the environment. In this case, it seems as though glyphosate was a major upgrade from most of its precursors, and should be factored into the analysis instead of solely using quantitative measurements in isolation. Additionally, although Glyphosate usage might have become more common since the advent of Round-Up Ready crops, it is worth noting that pesticide usage has dramatically decreased since the advent of Bt crops. Unlike Round-Up Ready seeds, which are plants engineered to be resistant to an herbicide, Bt-crops are crops engineered to produce a defense against the insects themselves, which means that the need for pesticides as an intermediate is virtually made redundant. A 2000 study found that since the introduction of Bt-crops, pesticide usage has decreased by 2 million lbs (Gianessi, 2000). Therefore, this should assure consumers that there is significantly less pesticide on the foods that they eat as compared to before.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>        This brings us to the second key reason for GMO rejection: the organic revolution. Organic foods for the purpose of this paper may be defined as a production method that does not utilize chemical pesticides, gene manipulation techniques, growth enhancement hormones or antibiotics (Davis, 2006). The movement started around the 1900s and has seen an immense growth in popularity and demand since then. One study tracking the movement found that “Organic sales have increased by nearly 20% annually since 1990, with consumer sales reaching $13.8 billion in 2005” (Davis, 2006).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/GMO_files/organic_foods.jpg" width="450" height="450" /></p>
<font size="2"><i><b>Figure 5:</b>Plot showing the immense growth of the organic foods industry since 2006 (Jagiello, 2016)</i></font>
<br>
<br>
<p>        The main appeal of organic foods, and the motivation for spending a few extra dollars on them, is the fact that they have always been marketed as ‘all-natural’ or ‘traditional’. These claims usually lead consumers to associate them with better health and lower risks. However, surprisingly enough, there has been no solid data to support the claim that organic foods are better for human health than GMO foods. On examining clinical outcomes with human samples, nutrient and biomarker levels in urine, breast milk, semen, and serum did not show any significant differences between the GMO and organic food treatment groups (Crystal Smith-Spangler, 2012). Further, when speaking from environmental terms, proponents of this method of farming who claim that it is better for the environment fail to see that it requires an enormous amount of land to be scaled up. A 2019 study found that “To have produced all of the US agricultural output from 2016 as organic would have required more than 100 million more acres to have been farmed—an area greater than that of the entire state of California, the third largest US state” (Savage, 2019).</p>

<p>        The consequences of all of the above facets of the problem have resulted in a great mitigation of GMO research and development and much stricter regulation. Public attempts to thwart the progress of GMOs, even in situations where they would be highly beneficial and, in some cases, life-saving, are well-documented and abundant. The best example of this is the Golden Rice Project. This humanitarian project started back in 1980 with the aim of enriching conventional rice with Beta-carotene in order to prevent starvation and malnutrition (and subsequent blindness from vitamin A deficiency) in regions that did not have access to naturally vitamin-A-enriched foods. However, due to the stigma around GMOs, nearly 40 years later, it is still awaiting approval from regulatory boards for distribution to farmers (Board, n.d.).</p>

<p>        Ultimately, as mentioned by Jimmy Botella in his 2013 TEDxUG talk on GMOs, it all boils down to people being scared of what they don’t understand. Rutgers University conducted a GMO awareness survey in 2013 of over 1,000 participants and revealed the sheer extent of this. The survey found that over 50% of respondents knew little to nothing about what a genetically modified food is and a quarter of the participants had never even heard of GMOs (William K. Hallman, 2013 ).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/GMO_files/gmo_opinions.jpg" width="600" height=600" /></p>
<font size="2"><i><b>Figure 6:</b>Additional consumer GMO surveys corroborating the fact that very little is known about GMOs in the non-scientific community (Gatto, 2015)</i></font>
<br>
<br>
<p>        To understand how much of a difference public information dispensed from purely scientific personnel can make, let me reference the GMO ‘For’ vs ‘Against’ Debate that took place in New York City a few year ago. A pre-debate survey showed that only 32% of the audience of 450 were ‘for’ GMOs, with the other 68% either ‘against’ or ‘undecided’. After a stimulating argument with the champions of the GMO field on the ‘for’ side – Robert Fraley (CTO of Monsanto) and Alison Van Eenennaam (animal geneticist at UC Davis) – putting forth their opinions about GMOs and debunking false claims, the post-debate survey reflected an increase in the ‘for’ side to a whopping 60% (Crew, 2014). This shows us that people are indeed capable of changing their opinions if they are provided with the adequate resources. More public information forums like this could allow people to have all the facts and enable them to make their own educated decisions accordingly.</p>

<p>        I’d like to conclude by pointing out that in some ways, the aggressive resistance to GMOs by the public is a very warranted reaction. Leading GMO companies like Monsanto don't exactly instill a sense of instinctive trust in people because of their complicated past and historical association with very problematic compounds like PCBs, DDT, Dioxin, and of course the well-known Agent Orange, which is responsible for ailments and deaths of at least 1 million Vietnam war veterans (USDVA, n.d.). Even outside of agriculture, pharmaceutical companies leverage disease and suffering to make profits and purposefully fail to regulate the dispersal of harmful medications like Fentanyl. Further, in a generation where everything is being questioned and debated, from the safety of vaccinating young children to the very shape of the Earth, it comes as no surprise that consumers have learned to be cautious about almost everything. Therefore, although it might get frustrating at times to see emotion and feelings trump scientific fact, it is our responsibility as a scientific community to regain the trust of the public and educate them about how GMOs can help our society in immeasurable ways.</p>

One incredible advantage of R-Markdown is its ability as a platform to be compatible with tons of languages apart from R, such as: Python, SQL, Javascript, CSS, and more. R is a powerful tool, but sometimes it becomes necessary to use a different language like Python that is faster and contains packages that might not be available in R.
Here, we explore how to use Python in R-Markdown and provide an introduction to Python basics.

```{r setup, echo = TRUE}
# To be able to use Python, we need to install the 'reticulate' package which makes Python and R interoperable
library(reticulate)
```

Functions are very useful because they save us time that would otherwise have been spent rewriting chunks of code over and over again.

```{python}
# this function takes in a string as its input and reverses it!
def reverse_string (word):
    result = ""
    for i in word :
         result = i + result
    return result      

# call the function
print("your string reversed looks like: ",reverse_string("the house was made of jellybeans"))

```
Regular expression (RegEx) is also handy when looking for specific patterns in large files as opposed to doing it manually. For example, given the very large string of letters and numbers below, if we wanted to extract only the urls, we could use re.findall() to specify what we are looking for it and return a list of all the matching subset strings. 

```{python}
# import the RegEx package 
import re

string = "<http://www.classmates.com/go/e/200988231/CC123101BT/CM00>  <http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/spacer.gif>  <http://graphics.classmates.com/graphics/sp \

# match all strings beginning with 'http' and ending with a space
urls = re.findall(r"http.*?\s", string) 

# each element of the array can then be printed out on separate lines using a for loop
for i in urls:
  print(i)

Here is an example of a function that is useful in a biological context. This function counts the number of '3-mers', which are all the possible 3-base long subsets of a given sequence as outlined in the image below:
![](/blog/PythoninR_files/kmers.jpeg){width=400px height=400px}
```{python}

def find_threemers(seq):
    dictionary = {} # intitialize dictionary
    for i in range(len(seq) - 1): # loop through the sequence
        mer = seq[i : i+3] # slice the first three letters each time
        if len(mer) == 3: # only consider three-letter slices
            if mer in dictionary:
                dictionary[mer] += 1 # if threemer already in the dictionary, increase its frequency by 1
                i += 1
            else:
                dictionary[mer] = 1 # if threemer not yet in the dictionary, add it
                i += 1
        else:
            print(dictionary) #print out the dictionary

sequence_1 = "ATCATCATG"
sequence_2 = "CAGCCCAATCAGGCTCTACTGCCACTAAACTTACGCAGGATATATTTACGCCGACGTACT"

# call the function on the above 2 sequences
find_threemers(sequence_1)
find_threemers(sequence_2)
```

<p>We are slowly realizing as a population of almost 8 billion, that the effects of climate change are no longer a problem for the future generations and more of an imminent problem to the current inhabitants of this planet. Evidence of climate change is abundant, from the rise in global temperature by 2°C since the preindustrial era (Dahlman, 2020) to the deterioration of infrastructure - buildings and roads - in countries like Canada due to the melting of the permafrost in which they had their foundations built (Uzarowski, 2018). A decline in the amount of objects with high albedo levels is also evident from the fact that glaciers in Kilimanjaro have drastically reduced in volume (Georg Kaser, 2003). What’s more, climate change is also threatening the very sources of our oxygen; ocean acidification, resulting from the rise in marine carbon dioxide levels by nearly 40% in the last 250 years (Scott C.Doney, 2009), is making conditions uninhabitable for oceanic phytoplankton populations that currently produce 50% of the Earth's oxygen (Monika Winder, 2012).</p>

<p>        The soils of Earth contain approximately 2,500 gigatons of carbon; this is almost triple the amount of carbon in the atmosphere (Cho, 2018). And they are capable of storing much more if conditions are favorable. The element in soil that makes it such a good reservoir of carbon is known as ‘humus’. Humus is the dark brown or black fine-smelling substance found in the top 10-13cms of top-soil that makes up 65-75% of the total organic matter in soil (E.Pettit, 2008). It plays a crucial part in the natural carbon cycle by ensuring that when organic matter from dead plants and animals is broken down, not all of the carbon is released into the atmosphere as carbon dioxide and some of this stays in the soil (E.Pettit, 2008). The single most important organism that facilitates the production of humus is arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AM fungi). Despite the importance of these microbes to soil health and the maintenance of healthy humus levels in the soil, their colonies are currently on the decline due to the advent of human activities that seek to minimize agricultural costs and maximize scale and profits.</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Humus_files/carpophores.jpg" width="350" height="350" /></p>
<font size="2"><i>Figure 2:For ectomycorrhizal fungi, one indicator of its presence is the presence of fungal carpophores (the fruiting axis of the fungus). Therefore, the decline in sightings of these the mycorrhizal Boletacese and C.cibarus relative to the non-mycorrhi mycorrhizal A.mellea indicates a general decline in EM fungi over a time span of 15 years (Termorshuizen, 1990)</i></font>
 
 
 
<p>        Deforestation, traditional slash and burn agricultural strategies, wildfires, and the usage of NPK fertilizers are among some of the main causes of mycorrhizal fungal colony deterioration. Traditional agricultural practices that have been practiced for centuries for the purposes of quick farming - such as tillage - also contribute to the destruction of humus by exposing carbon microaggregates and allowing them to be degraded by moisture and enzymes that they were formerly protected from (J.Balesdent, 2000). Air pollution is also a serious contributor to this reduction as well because these organisms are very sensitive to changes in pH and are easily damaged by dissolved SO2 and NO-x emissions, which become very strong acids when dissolved in water (L.J.C. Xavier, 1999).</p>

<p>        If nothing is done to remedy this situation and remediate the soil with these fungi, we will no longer be able to rely on soil as a reservoir for all the excess carbon dioxide we have in the atmosphere. Soil carbon sequestration is one of the few ways we can remove instead of curb carbon dioxide levels and it is also the most effective mechanism simply due to the chemical properties of carbon dioxide that make it linger around in the atmosphere for thousands of years (Al-Ghussain, 2018). Carbon dioxide has entered a very dangerous positive feedback loop with the melting of the permafrost – carbon dioxide heats the Earth via the greenhouse effect, causing the permafrost to melt and release its ancient trapped carbon and methane along with the dormant colonies of microbes that are capable of breaking these two down into carbon dioxide (Oliver Muller, 2018).</p>

<p>        In terms of carbon sequestration, soil is not the only way to go, and some even argue that geological carbon sequestration – where industrial carbon dioxide emissions are pressurized into a liquid and then pumped into the porous rock formations for long term storage – is another better alternative since this method can store up to 3,700 metric gigatons of carbon dioxide (USGS, 2013). However, preliminary analysis shows that this would cost $120-$140 per ton of CO2 (Barnard, 2016). There has also been talk of pumping these carbon dioxide emissions into the absorbent sediment in the deepest regions of the ocean (oceanic sequestration). The rationale behind this is the fact that at certain regions, the surrounding oceanic temperature and pressure would be optimal for making carbon dioxide relatively denser, essentially trapping it in place permanently (Bullis, 2006). However, the major con for this proposal would be the detriment to marine life. Although some specific species in deep sea trench areas that can survive high carbon dioxide concentration environment, there will most certainly be a much larger number that cannot. Further, there is always the chance of strong currents carrying this carbon dioxide to shallower areas, in which case it would also contribute to coral bleaching. With biological sequestration, there definitely are still costs but reduction of carbon dioxide emissions won’t be the only gain. As a planet that is exponentially growing, a reliable food source is becoming the limiting factor, and healthy soils would be a good start to securing that. Humus-rich soils would not only be beneficial for better crop yield – which would allow us to use fewer acres of land for agricultural purposes - but also for compact soil that is resistant to erosion. Humus can hold 4-20 times its own weight in water (Jones, 2014), which makes it a better defense against flooding - an increasingly common consequence of climate change (Denchak, 2019). In light of the cost-benefit analyses of each of these methods, it seems as though biological soil sequestration is a strong and viable option.</p>

<p>        The exact composition of humus has remained somewhat of a mystery due to complications associated with separating individual compounds in it that have very similar chemical properties and are soluble in the same reagents (Snyder, 1897). That being said, we do know of a few fairly consistent components of humus: humins, humic acids, and fulvic acids. Humins are large organic molecules with molecular weights as high as 10,000,000 g/mol; (E.Pettit, 2008). They make up the insoluble component of the topsoil and are especially resistant to microbial decomposition; this is also what makes them a strong contributor to soil stability. Some examples of humins are aliphatic hydrocarbons that are found in cutin, suberin, and lipids (Michael H.B. Hayes, 2017). Humic acids – defined as any humic molecule with an abundance of hydrogen ions (T.L. Senn, 1973) – are only soluble in water at high soil pH levels. Their significance emerges from their ability to act as a soil buffer by facilitating cation-exchange, increasing the uptake of nutrients by plants, and bind certain crucial ions for slow release to plants (Larry Cooper, 2017). Finally, fulvic acids are slightly more chemically reactive than humic acids and include weak aromatic and aliphatic compounds that are soluble in water regardless of pH level. Since they are relatively smaller than humic acids, they are capable of carrying scarce minerals in the soil directly into a plant via its roots and delivering them to sites of metabolism (E.Pettit, 2008).</p>

<p>        The organism behind this substance - Arbuscular mycorrhizae (AM) - are ‘obligate fungal symbionts’, meaning that they are required to form a mutually beneficial relationship with plants in order to survive (Jones, 2014). The positive correlation between AM colony abundance and the amount of organic matter in the soil has been observed numerous times (Marcos P.M. Aidar, 2003). AM fungi penetrate the roots of plants and form a complex network inside and outside the root for exchange of micronutrients like Phosphorus that are very scarce in the soil. Besides nutrient transport, they also help with increased resistance to stressors like drought, salinity, and disease, a higher rate of photosynthesis, and more efficient transport of fixed carbon from the leaves to the root (Naheeda Begum, 2019). AM hyphae secrete an adhesive compound called ‘glomalin’ which causes soil aggregation. This soil aggregation has a more significant purpose than simply keeping the soil together. Carbon is usually easily broken down in the soil due to the accessibility to reaction-facilitating moisture and the fact that the soil is rich with a myriad of microorganisms that are capable of decomposing organic molecules to completion. The aggregation of soil makes Carbon resistant to microbial decomposition, effectively keeping more of the Carbon in the ground and resulting in less returning to the atmosphere as carbon dioxide (Ajay Pal, 2014). This is at the core of humus’ role in carbon sequestration.</p>

<font size="2"><i>Figure 3:The relationship between mycorrhiza colonization percentage and the percentage of organic matter in the soil shows that the two variables are directly proportional (Marcos P.M. Aidar, 2003).</i></font>
 
 
 
<p>        What can we do about this reduction of humus levels worldwide? There are numerous ways of making the soil more habitable for AM fungi. These include reforestation, crop residue mulching, and enforcing stricter policies on tillage (McBratney, 2017). Although each of these might be effective in their own way, they are very long-term solutions and will rely too much on governmental policies and restructuring the lifestyles of individual citizens. The best course of action for remediation of the soils, that has been attempted before and for which we have data is the inoculation of soil with arbuscular mycorrhizae.</p>

<p>        Before discussing solutions to this method, let’s talk about the most significant consideration from a financial, political, and social point of view: will it work? Fortunately, evidence that this solution does indeed work is abundant from studies that compare the carbon content of soil with and without these mycorrhizal fungi. One such study treated alfisol (a slightly acidic soil) with endophytic fungi and saw an increase in carbon microaggregates by up to 17% (A, 2016). Knowing that this method works in advance can greatly assist the process of proving feasibility to farmers and agricultural manufacturers who would have stake in such a project. What makes soil inoculation such an elegant solution is the fact that virtually any part of the arbuscular mycorrhizae can be used to make the inoculum whether it is mycorrhizal spores, colonized crop root fragments, or viable mycorrhizal hyphae (Molly Lohman, 2010). There are multiple methods of soil inoculation including coating the seeds with mycorrhizal propagules prior to seeding, dipping the roots of plants in powder or water solutions containing the inoculum, integrating the inoculum into the irrigation system, or directly distributing the propagules into the soils (Racsko, 2019). The method used in the 1993 paper ‘A new method to quantify the inoculum potential of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi’, starts off this process by surface-sterilizing the seeds of the host plant to be used with NaOCl and then sowing them in pots full of steamed sand that have been inoculated with at least 2,500 spores of arbuscular mycorrhizae (the strains used in this paper were Glomus mosseae and Glomus versiforme). 5g root fragments could alternatively be used in place of spores (R.-J. LIU, 1993). This same research paper has also found a way to measure the ‘inoculum potential’ (IP), which can be measured by assessing the number of viable propagules along with the initial infective potential of the mycorrhizae strains on the roots of the plants that are being treated. This is a further benefit for this method because it will help us find the ‘best’ strain of arbuscular mycorrhizae to use for the inoculum by comparing their IPs (R.-J. LIU, 1993).</p>

<font size="2"><i>Figure 4: A table from the 'A new method to quantify the inoculum' paper showing all the parameters that factor into calculating the 'inoculum potential' of the various strains of arbuscular mycorrhizae used in the inoculum. Of these three strains, it appears as though Glomus versiforme seems to perform best on all three host plants (R.-J. LIU, 1993).</i></font>
 
 
 

<p>        Like any effort to remediate the soils, there are associated complications; I will discuss the primary obstacles to making this method of soil remediation prevalent. The first issue is the naturally the cost of this project. For this strategy to actually make a difference, it will have to be performed on an extremely large scale, and with that will come large costs.  Inoculants can cost around $28-$32/lb (Phillips G. , 2012), making it a costly operation once it is performed on a global or even national scale. Another problem along a similar thread is the fact that this soil inoculation cannot be performed in isolation; a large part of this attempt will be reducing the amount of NPK fertilizers and fungicides we use while simultaneously replacing them with these natural fertilizers. NPK fertilizers hamper the growth of AM colonies. When plants have an excess of Nitrogen in the soil around them, they neglect the AM fungi they are in a symbiotic relationship with and fail to supply them with the Nitrogen they need to survive. In addition to this, chemical fertilizers mess with the osmotic balance of the soil, reduces the pH, and causes ions to leach, leaving fewer nutrients for the survival and sustenance of AM fungi (McLin, 2013). The problem is, as a nation, we have grown very dependent on these fertilizers because they are the quick and obvious catalysts to high harvests while incurring very low costs. The United States alone used almost 200 million tonnes of chemical fertilizers in the past year (Nations, 2016) and this number is projected to only go up. The recent acceptance and even popularity of GMO crops has made the lives of farmers all over the world a whole lot easier because if crops are, for example, glyphosate-resistant, herbicides can be generously applied to large areas of land in a non-targeted fashion. This both increases yields and saves costs on intensive manual labor. Getting farmers to switch from this comfortable method of growing to a more organic approach will be a challenge. The only likely way NPK fertilizers could be regulated is if they were integrated into a soil remediation act or a governmental law.</p>

<font size="2"><i>Figure 6: A visualization of chemical fertilizer usage mapped across the globe to demonstrate their accessibility and demand (Ritchie, 2020).</i></font>
 
 
 
<p>        The adverse effects of fungicides on AM colonies are more straightforward than those of NPK fertilizers. Fungicides, although not specifically designed to harm mycorrhizae in soil, are often non-selective, meaning that they wipe out all species of fungi, regardless of whether the fungi are beneficial or not for plant growth. Unfortunately, this includes arbuscular mycorrhizae as well, as demonstrated in a 1997 study that measured the effects of biocides and fungicides on non-target organisms in the soil. This study observed the effect that two fungicides - Benomyl and pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB) – had on the germination and early-hyphal growth stages of various colonies of AM and found that they caused the length of root colonized by these AM fungi to decrease in as little as 48 days (Bethlenfalvay, 1997).</p>
<p><img src="/blog/Humus_files/strain_performance.jpg" width="350" height="550" /></p>
<font size="2"><i>Figure 7: Graphs showing the effect of three fungicides – Benomy, pentachloronitrobenzene (PCNB), and Captan – on the length of plant root colonized by three different strains of AM – Glomus etunicatum, Glomus mosseae, and Glomus rosea (Bethlenfalvay, 1997). Although not all three fungicides have equally detrimental effects on the AM colonization, each case shows a clear reduction when compared to the control.</i></font>
 
 
 
<p>        A further human related complication is related to the aforementioned difficulties with determining the exact composition of humus because this has raised a certain level of skepticism regarding its existence. In 2015, Nature magazine published an article titled ‘The contentious nature of soil organic matter’ which is about how the lack of humus’ observation by modern analytical techniques coupled with its very generic definitions for ‘humins’, ‘humic acids’, and ‘fulvic acids’ makes it unlikely that this soil layer even exists (Kleber, 2015). This skepticism could hamper the belief people have in this attempt to remediate the soil.</p>

<p>        Moving on to the more biological issues, as an obligate symbiont, these mycorrhizae cannot simply exist in isolation of plants. Like in any symbiotic relationship, they require a portion of the carbohydrates generated by plants because they are incapable of producing these themselves. A related factor that complicates the execution of this solution is the fact that mycorrhizae do not just form this relationship with any plant. Specific strains of AM usually have preferences, as was demonstrated in the reciprocal transplant experiment of 1996. This experiment tested the ability of mycorrhizal fungi to colonize species of shrubs that had not previously been inoculated with them. Of the 5 AM fungal samples chosen - Acaulospora elegans, Scutellospora calospora, two different whole‐soil inoculums from different regions, and uninoculated soil – all showed a deterioration in survival ability when grown with a species of plant they were previously unfamiliar with (Barbara S. Weinbaum, 1996). This poses a serious problem for standardizing the method of soil inoculation across a variety of regions (that each have unique soil types) and plants native to those regions. A third complication is the fact that although mycorrhizae is known to adapt to multiple biological, geological, and climatic conditions, this only applies up to a certain extent and this soil inoculation method is unlikely to work on arid or semi-arid regions because the soil here is lacking more than just humus and mycorrhizae (R.Lal, 1997). A further area of consideration would be adapting the strain of AM used to not only the host plant it is growing on, but also the soil that it is growing in. A 2010 research paper on soil-strain compatibility conducted over 500 trials of inoculation attempts in various soil types and came to some conclusions about which soil inoculums to use in which soils. According to this paper, Glomus fasciculatum and Glomus etunicatum like strains performed best in soils that were already highly enriched with nutrients and organic matter. Glomus manihotis perfomed best in medium-enriched soils, and Paraglomus occultum and Glomus mosseae-like strains performed best in poorly enriched soils (Ricardo A. Herrera-Peraza, 2010). This information could be used to customize inoculum type based on region.</p>

<p>        In conclusion, restoring the colonies of arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi in our soil is a very promising potential method of remediating the soil and increasing organic humus levels with minimal consequences to the environment because we know for a fact that it increases carbon content in soil. It has been estimated that if topsoil soil quality increased by 0.01%, per year, carbon sequestration would occur at the rate of 3.0 Pg per year – the same as the rate of carbon dioxide formation in the atmosphere (R.Lal, 1997). The carbon cycle already fixes carbon in the soil naturally, thus an intervention in this cycle would have fewer adverse effects on the rest of the environment than would other proposals such as oceanic carbon dioxide sequestration – which would simply take the problem of excess emissions from the atmosphere to the ocean. The fact that AM soil inoculation has been a subject of numerous research papers has also given us a starting point in terms of data that we could use to optimize an inoculum and ensure that we use the correct AM strains with appropriate host plants and soils. 
Most importantly though, we need to realize that fungal inoculation to improve soil organic matter cannot be effective in a vacuum; this fact is also perhaps what will make it most frustrating and difficult to execute. Tillage procedures must be either halted or shifted to more conservative methods, fungicides need to be banned or chemically/biologically altered to not target and kill these helpful mycorrhizae, and NPK fertilizers need to slowly be replaced by more organic solutions that are not harmful to the naturally occurring soil microbiome. The solid evidence that exists - in the form of studies that demonstrate that soil with these types of mycorrhizae, do in fact have higher carbon contents – will certainly aid the process of championing these ideas to the masses. However, as with any effort to change industrial or agricultural procedures, there will be numerous obstacles that will have to be overcome in the context of convincing the stakeholders in agriculture of the long-term effectiveness of mycorrhizae as a soil remediator, or finding a more low-cost method of manufacturing and delivering it to the soil.</p>
